One thing I want to do in python is read in a file and compare it to another
file on a field by field basis.

This will be useful for comparing lists of hosts.

This program needs to read in the contents of two or more files, sort them
by a specific column, and then loop through one and lookup in the other



Another thing I want to write in python is a file system scanner that writes
the details of the files and directories into a database like mariadb.

Then write code to examine the contents to show which directories are growing,
the age of files, the count of files with certain characteristics like
filename, date, timestamp, etc.

It would be really awesome to display this in an interactive web interface
and you could click on columns so sort and filter.


Another project is an improved printer maintenance script for SKP.


One of the first things I need to do is start writing python scripts every 
day. This will help me start thinking in python instead of bash.

I should also start using git every day instead of plain old stampit. The
stampit script should be used on a live system to make a backup for something
that is not already in version control.


I should go through some of the code and the lessons in python the hard way.
